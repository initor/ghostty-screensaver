The 235 ASCII animation frames are reused from the public [ghostty-org/website](https://github.com/ghostty-org/website) repo under MIT — see [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements).

A native macOS `.saver` bundle that loops [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)'s homepage 235-frame ASCII animation through Core Text. Universal binary, 30 Hz, or 15 Hz in Low Power Mode. Pure Objective-C — no Electron, no WebView, no daemons.

## Install

1. Download `ghostty.saver.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/initor/ghostty-screensaver/releases) and unzip it.
2. Double-click `ghostty.saver`. macOS opens **System Settings → Screen Saver** with **Ghostty Screensaver** ready to install.
3. If macOS prompts about an unidentified developer, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to *Security*, and click **Open Anyway**.

That's it. Verify the universal slice landed:

```bash
lipo -archs ~/Library/Screen\ Savers/ghostty.saver/Contents/MacOS/ghostty
# x86_64 arm64
```

<details>
<summary><b>"ghostty.saver is damaged and can't be opened"</b></summary>

Unsigned releases ship with a Gatekeeper quarantine flag. The file isn't damaged — strip the flag and re-open:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/ghostty.saver
```

Adjust the path if you unzipped elsewhere. Signed/notarized releases skip this step. See the [Why is it unsigned?](#faq) FAQ entry below.

`legacyScreenSaver` caches `.saver` bundles per process. Force a reload:

```bash
killall legacyScreenSaver 2>/dev/null
```

## Compatibility

|                              | Apple Silicon (arm64) | Intel (x86_64)             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **macOS 12** Monterey (min)  | Supported             | Supported                  |
| **macOS 13** Ventura         | Supported             | Supported                  |
| **macOS 14** Sonoma          | Supported             | Supported                  |
| **macOS 15** Sequoia         | CI-built, smoke-tested | CI-built (universal slice) |
| **macOS 26** Tahoe           | UAT'd                 | Not tested                 |

Single universal `.saver` (`ARCHS = arm64 x86_64`, `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 12.0`). No per-architecture code paths.

## How it works

`GhosttyView` is an `NSScreenSaverView` subclass loaded by macOS's `legacyScreenSaver` host. Each tick it builds a fresh `CTFramesetter` + `CTFrame` from the current pre-attributed frame and releases both before returning — Core Text instead of `NSLayoutManager` because the latter's caches grew unboundedly under per-frame `setAttributedString:` swaps (~1.6 KB/frame, no plateau over 7050 frames on macOS 26). The 235-element `NSAttributedString` array loads once per process, shared across every `NSScreen`, the System Settings preview pane, and view re-instantiations. The view is layer-backed (`wantsLayer = YES`) so the per-tick black background is a `CALayer.backgroundColor` GPU composite, not a CPU `NSRectFill`.

- 30 Hz, or 15 Hz in Low Power Mode (via `NSProcessInfoPowerStateDidChangeNotification`).
- Frame array singleton — multi-display + Settings preview share one ~2.7 MB load.
- `drawRect:` builds one `CTFramesetter` and one `CTFrame` per tick and releases both. Placement is cached per bounds, and the whole-cycle ink midpoint is measured once per process.
- `os_signpost` Points-of-Interest are always on — Instruments-ready, zero cost when detached.

## FAQ

> **Why does macOS say the file is "damaged" or "from an unidentified developer"?**

The release `.zip` is unsigned (no Apple Developer ID), so macOS quarantines it on download and shows a misleading error. Run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/ghostty.saver` to clear the flag, or click **Open Anyway** in *System Settings → Privacy & Security* after the first failed open. Signed/notarized builds skip both prompts; the GitHub Actions release workflow produces one automatically when an Apple cert is configured.

> **My new build doesn't show up after re-installing — what gives?**

`legacyScreenSaver` caches `.saver` bundles per process and won't pick up a fresh install until it restarts. Run `killall legacyScreenSaver` (or reboot) and re-open *System Settings → Screen Saver*.

> **Does it work on multiple displays / external monitors?**

Yes. macOS instantiates one `GhosttyView` per active screen; the 235-frame array is a process singleton (`dispatch_once`), so multi-display setups share a single ~2.7 MB load instead of paying it per screen. All displays animate independently at the same rate.

> **What's the battery / CPU impact?**

About 9 percent of one core at 30 Hz on an M4 at 1080p, about half that at 15 Hz in Low Power Mode. The view is layer-backed, so WindowServer composites on the GPU. To be extra conservative on battery, toggle Low Power Mode.

> **How do I customize the colors or supply my own ASCII art?**

See [FRAMES.md](FRAMES.md) for filename rules, encoding, span syntax, and adding a highlight color. Drop new frames into `ghostty/static/animation_frames/` and rebuild — no code changes needed for content.

> **How do I uninstall?**

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Screen\ Savers/ghostty.saver
killall legacyScreenSaver 2>/dev/null
```

That's the whole footprint — no launch agents, no preferences pane, no `~/Library/Application Support` directory. (If you installed under `/Library/Screen Savers/` for all users, use `sudo` and that path instead.)

## Develop

```bash
git clone https://github.com/initor/ghostty-screensaver.git
cd ghostty-screensaver
open ghostty.xcodeproj   # Xcode 16.2+
```

Press <kbd>⌘ R</kbd> to run the saver in Xcode's preview pane, or <kbd>⌘ B</kbd> to build without launching. For an end-to-end test against the real `legacyScreenSaver` host, do a Release build (`Product → Archive`, or `xcodebuild -configuration Release`), copy `ghostty.saver` into `~/Library/Screen Savers/`, and `killall legacyScreenSaver`.

Pure Objective-C, ARC. Rendering uses Core Text. For history: `git log --follow -- ghostty/GhosttyView.m`.

### Logs

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.initor.ghostty-screensaver"'
```

`os_signpost` intervals (`FrameLoad`, `DrawFrame`, `Tick`) appear in **Instruments → Points of Interest** with no extra build flags.

### Releasing

Every push to `main` (including a merged PR) automatically publishes the next patch release **after CI succeeds**. PR builds and failed CI runs never publish. The release uses the exact commit CI checked, and rerunning CI for an already-released commit does not create another version.

CI builds a universal `.saver`, runs native rendering checks against it, and uploads a candidate ZIP and sample PNGs as an Actions artifact. The release workflow repeats the rendering checks before publication. To run the same checks locally against a downloaded bundle:

```bash
bash tests/verify-rendering.sh /path/to/ghostty.saver ./build/verification
```

For an explicit minor or major version, push a `vX.Y.Z` tag on `main`. Manual dispatch of the Release workflow accepts an existing tag for retries. Releases are serialized; an existing published asset is not overwritten.

The workflow signs and notarizes if `DEVELOPER_ID_*` / `APPLE_*` secrets are configured, otherwise it ad-hoc-signs and ships with quarantine instructions in the release notes.

All artistic credit for the animation belongs to the upstream authors. The wrapper around them — `ScreenSaverView` host, frame loader, build pipeline — is original work.
